                        This initiative is a web application offering Buddhist traditional scriptures and learning experiences, embracing modernity and creativity with practical solutions for students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Its core mission is twofold: first, to provide support to the living transmissions of scripture passed down by our Buddhist teachers; and second, to share open digital environments for students to access specific genres of the Tengyur catalog and their corresponding Tibetan commentaries.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Content and Audience</h2>

                    <p>
                        Among the numerous texts that conform the Buddhist scriptural collections, the content gathered here focuses primarily on the Mahayana studies, Indian Buddhist texts written down during the Golden Age of Buddhist philosophy in India. Alongside, students will find texts from the major commentarial traditions on Indian texts that developed in Tibet from the 8th century onwards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The commentaries presented here correspond to the curriculums at Tibetan monastic colleges (shedras), sets of texts initially standardized by Je Tsongkhapa (around 14th century) into major topics such as Prajnapāramitās, Madhyamaka, Pramana, Abhidharma, and Vinaya. Subsequently, several standardizations of study texts were also developed by other major Tibetan schools, each gathering their own commentaries under specific classifications of genres or topics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an invitation to meet the great masters Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Shantideva, Shantarakshita, Chandrakirti, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dignaga, Dharmakirti, and many others, to read and study their seminal works in light of elucidatory commentaries composed by Tibetan masters from the outstanding traditions arisen from the Roof of the World.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It aims to be an offering to students of Buddhism longing for deepening readership, understanding, and contemplation of some of the most transformational Mahayana texts one could possibly study in a lifetime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While hoping that this catalog might be useful, it should be emphasized the vital importance of receiving direct teachings from qualified teachers who can transmit the profound meaning of these texts. May this experiment contribute to the ongoing conversations and efforts on the Buddhist digital sphere to support living transmissions of scripture.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Three Project Considerations</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Encrypted Yet Accessible</li>
                        <li>Many traditions, One Goal</li>
                        <li>One Life-time Opportunity</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>1. Encrypted Yet Accessible</h3>

                    <p>
                        The first consideration here is a reflection on the universal naked wisdom to be revealed in Buddha's teachings encompassing a profound and compassionate message to humanity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For more than 2.500 years, Buddha's teachings have survived thanks to uninterrupted streams of realizations carried out by many accomplished masters from a myriad of Buddhist traditions around the world. Preserved in various forms over time, these teachings are been passed down to us not without the foreseen contingencies for changes in the language and cultures, throughout centuries of uncertainties and opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contemplating the becoming world it emerges the aspiration for these teachings to be always present thanks to the activity of unwavering bodhisattvas and our striving for awakening. Offsprings of the Victorious One in consonance continue decrypting and applying the teachings in meaningful ways, making them accessible and relevant to students and practitioners, and to the world in general without hesitation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Many Traditions, One Open Goal</h3>

                    <p>
                        The processes of interpretation, validation, and assimilation of the teachings have given rise to an entropic development of numerous doctrines and traditions. The resulting diversification of Buddha's teachings is a testament of their adaptability at core, while at present facing the paradoxical possibility for these teachings to become more irrelevant to a world turning increasingly endangered, and deeply disturbed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second consideration here is a dear appreciation of the skillful ways in which Buddha's teachings accommodate to the various types of individuals, temperaments, capacities, provisional circumstances, and life styles. This appreciation renders here as the intent for an ecumenic, empathetic, and accessible presentation of relevant scriptures and learning paths to support adaptive Buddhist living transmissions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. One Lifetime Window Opportunity</h3>

                    <p>
                        The third consideration here is the contemplation of the fragile perfect human birth, with the qualities of leisure and endowment, and the mind with trust, longing, and clarity. For such rare lifetime opportunity in our busy and distracting world, one may wonder:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How many core Dharma texts one can thoroughly study in this lifetime?</li>
                        <li>How much quality time one can put into the study and contemplation of Dharma texts?</li>
                        <li>How much time one can dedicate to the cultivation of bodhicitta?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        In light of these challenges, this initiative focuses on solving real problems to scriptural accessibility to support students in the familiarization of texts and assimilation of meanings. Leveraging the power of digital environments combined with skillful presentations, contemplative virtual experiences might be feasible.
                    </p>

                    <h2>User Experience Propositions</h2>

                    <p>
                        This initiative is conceived upon four interwoven experiences:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Browsing and searching the catalog easily</li>
                        <li>Personalizing desk spaces based on current user studies</li>
                        <li>Reading texts and taking learning paths, in conjunction or separately, at the Learning Room</li>
                        <li>Engaging with the community at the Social Room</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>1. Browse and Search the Catalog</h3>

                    <p>
                        The catalog brings a high visibility to schools and genres collections, it provides a fluid and mnemonic navigation system throughout, and intends to effortlessly show relationships between groups of texts. The goal is to design a browsing experience that is informative, highly functional, customizable, and pleasant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The search function, available contextually from anywhere, may include advance features such as full-text search, auto-completion suggestions, fuzzy searching, multi-level filtering, diacritics inference, and granular indexing and queries for a great performance and smooth experience. The goal is for students to enjoy searching textual content and exploring the catalog offerings, while encouraging curiosity and discovery.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Personalize Desk Spaces</h3>

                    <p>
                        The My Desk is student's personal domain allowing users to store and organize favorite content. The goal is to offer intuitive ways for building personal configurations (spaces) to instantly launch sessions at the Learning Room based on user studies.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Read Texts and Take Learning Paths</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Learning Room is a virtual space where students can read texts and take learning paths, in conjunction or separately, at the Learning Room based on user studies.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Engage with the Community</h3>

                    <p>
                        The Social Room is a virtual space where students can read texts and take learning paths, in conjunction or separately, at the Learning Room based on user studies.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Roadmap</h2>

                    <p>
                        The roadmap is a work in progress and is subject to change. The goal is to provide a clear and concise overview of the project's future direction and to give users a sense of the project's progress.
