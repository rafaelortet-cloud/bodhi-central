                                Khenpo Shenpen Nangwa, also known as Shenga (1871–1927), wrote famous annotational, interlinear or 'gloss' commentaries (<em>mchan 'grel</em>) on these texts in the early twentieth century. These were not original compositions, but rather extracts from Indian commentaries, selected by Shenga and inserted into the root texts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Khenpo Shenga composed many of his commentaries for the thirteen texts at the behest of Situ Pema Wangchok Gyalpo (<em>si tu padma dbang mchog rgyal po</em>, 1886–1952) during his time at Palpung (dpal spungs) Monastery between 1910 and 1918. Nevertheless, it is likely that he based these commentaries on explanations he had given earlier in his teaching career, during his tenure at Dzogchen Śrī Siṃha. And these, in turn, were likely based on the explanations of his own teacher, Orgyen Tenzin Norbu (<em>o rgyan bstan ’dzin nor bu</em>, 1841–1900), and may represent a tradition going back to Gyalsé Shenpen Thayé (1800–1855) or even earlier. The fact that Orgyen Tenzin Norbu's writings are unavailable makes a proper assessment difficult.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The texts would have originally been in a Prākrit, that is, a dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan closely related to Sanskrit. The exact form of Prākrit is unknown, and indeed it may not have been entirely standardized, since monastics from the earliest times were using different dialects. Indications in the Pali texts suggest that they were derived from an earlier version in Māgadhī, that is, the language of the kingdom of Magadha. It appears that they were standardized in later centuries to a dialect similar to that used widely across central India for inscriptions, with a partial Sanskritization. Nevertheless, these languages differ mostly in phonology, and apart from a few edge cases, changes from one form to another do not affect the meaning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The annotational commentaries were later adopted as the core of the curriculum at Kham-jé (<em>khams bye</em>) shedra at Dzongsar (<em>rdzong gsar</em>), which Shenga founded in 1918. This institution produced a number of celebrated scholars, several of whom founded shedras of their own, contributing to a revival of scholarship within the Sakya school, and further promoting the centrality of the thirteen texts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche (1846–1912) and other leading scholars of the Nyingma school produced commentaries on many of the thirteen treatises as part of a revival of Nyingma scholasticism. Mipham's goal was not to present summaries of Indian interpretations but to clarify what he saw as the distinctive Nyingma approach to philosophy. This role is evident in his commentary on the ninth chapter of the <em>Bodhicaryāvatāra</em> and other works, including some compiled posthumously from lecture notes taken by his disciples.

                                Editions of Khenpo Shenga's commentaries present the texts in a sequence based on the traditional division into Vinaya, Sūtra and Abhidharma. Here, the Sūtra category is further divided into the two traditions of Profound View (<em>lta ba zab mo</em>) and Vast Conduct (<em>rgya chen spyod pa</em>) and positioned after the Abhidharma. This sequence reflects another traditional division, the progression through the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma, in which the Vinaya and Abhidharma represent the first turning, the four treatises of the Profound View belong to the intermediate turning, and the Five Treatises of Maitreya (<em>byams chos sde lnga</em>) correspond to both the intermediate and final turnings.

                                Georges Dreyfus misidentified the thirteen texts in his The Sound of Two Hands Clapping: The Education of a Tibetan Buddhist Monk by excluding the <em>Bodhicaryāvatāra</em> and replacing it with Dharmakīrti's <em>Pramāṇavārttika</em>. Although recent editions of the thirteen texts include no fewer than eighteen root texts, the <em>Pramāṇavārttika</em> is not among them, nor did Khenpo Shenga write a commentary on it.
